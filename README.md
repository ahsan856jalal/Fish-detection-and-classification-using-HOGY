# Fish-detection-and-classification-using-HOGY
This algorithm detects and classifies fish instances under unconstrained environment using a hybrid of GMM, Optical flow and deep CNN based on YOLO . Preference is given to YOLO during hybridization when results from GMM-optical and YOLO are overlapping
